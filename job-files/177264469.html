The position involves research as well as development within higher-education teaching and learning with a particular emphasis on science education. The position will also include involvement in research and development across the faculties of University of Copenhagen and in relation to strategic initiatives across the university. The position is open from 1 January 2021 or as soon as possible thereafter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We seek a candidate with a research record within higher education teaching and learning. This can include research in research-integrating or research-based teaching, university students&amp;rsquo; background and experiences in science, the role of the cultural and institutional setting, disciplinary and interdisciplinary teaching and learning in higher education, university teacher competences, and curriculum development. Candidates with other research specialisms in teaching and learning in higher education will also be considered. The candidate should have documented experience with pedagogical development in higher education settings. Experience with activities aimed at the pedagogical development of university teachers will be considered an advantage, but is not a requirement. Applicants should document ability to collaborate with a broad range of disciplines, study programmes and disciplines on planning, implementing, and evaluating developmental and/or research projects concerning teaching and education at these departments. Experience with development work across different faculties will be considered an advantage, but is not a requirement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tenure-track assistant professor&amp;rsquo;s duties will primarily include research, including obligations with regard to publication, and research-based teaching with associated examination obligations. The candidate is expected to actively take part in running and developing the university&amp;rsquo;s educational programme for teachers, including teaching at courses and workshops offered by the department, and to become involved in the research and development activities within university pedagogy in collaboration with the department&amp;rsquo;s research group on university teaching. The tenure track assistant professor must have an academic standing showing internationally competitive research, and/or have internationally recognized high potential to make a future impact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Department of Science Education is an interdisciplinary department and the successful applicant is expected to engage in interdisciplinary activities in relation teaching and development work. It is a hallmark of our research to unite strong fundamental and applied research with high impact in society, including themes that are of particular interest to the University of Copenhagen in general as well as to the Faculty of Science in particular. It is not a requirement to be able to teach in Danish. UCPH has an International Staff Mobility office that assists international scholars with their relocation to Copenhagen; see &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://ism.ku.dk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://ism.ku.dk/&lt;/a&gt;.

					<strong>Tenure-track assistant professor of Higher Education Research</strong><br /><strong>Department of Science Education</strong><br
/><strong>Faculty of Science</strong><br /><strong>University of Copenhagen</strong><br /><br />The Department of Science Education, Section
for Science and Mathematics Education Research and Teaching (SMART), seeks an excellent scholar for a tenure-track position as assistant
professor in higher education research. The position involves research as well as development within higher-education teaching and learning
with a particular emphasis on science education. The position will also include involvement in research and development across the faculties
of University of Copenhagen and in relation to strategic initiatives across the university. The position is open from 1 January 2021 or as
soon as possible thereafter.<br /><br />We seek a candidate with a research record within higher education teaching and learning. This can
include research in research-integrating or research-based teaching, university students&rsquo; background and experiences in science, the
role of the cultural and institutional setting, disciplinary and interdisciplinary teaching and learning in higher education, university
teacher competences, and curriculum development. Candidates with other research specialisms in teaching and learning in higher education
will also be considered. The candidate should have documented experience with pedagogical development in higher education settings.
Experience with activities aimed at the pedagogical development of university teachers will be considered an advantage, but is not a
requirement. Applicants should document ability to collaborate with a broad range of disciplines, study programmes and disciplines on
planning, implementing, and evaluating developmental and/or research projects concerning teaching and education at these departments.
Experience with development work across different faculties will be considered an advantage, but is not a requirement.<br /><br />The
tenure-track assistant professor&rsquo;s duties will primarily include research, including obligations with regard to publication, and
research-based teaching with associated examination obligations. The candidate is expected to actively take part in running and developing
the university&rsquo;s educational programme for teachers, including teaching at courses and workshops offered by the department, and to
become involved in the research and development activities within university pedagogy in collaboration with the department&rsquo;s research
group on university teaching. The tenure track assistant professor must have an academic standing showing internationally competitive
research, and/or have internationally recognized high potential to make a future impact.<br /><br />The Department of Science Education is
an interdisciplinary department and the successful applicant is expected to engage in interdisciplinary activities in relation teaching and
development work. It is a hallmark of our research to unite strong fundamental and applied research with high impact in society, including
themes that are of particular interest to the University of Copenhagen in general as well as to the Faculty of Science in particular. It is
not a requirement to be able to teach in Danish. UCPH has an International Staff Mobility office that assists international scholars with
their relocation to Copenhagen; see <a rel="noopener" href="https://ism.ku.dk/" target="_blank">https://ism.ku.dk/</a>. Information on life
in Denmark is available on the official website <a rel="noopener" href="https://lifeindenmark.borger.dk/"

href="https://international.kk.dk/artikel/everyday-life-copenhagen"
target="_blank">https://international.kk.dk/artikel/everyday-life-copenhagen</a>.<br /><br />Assessment of applicants will primarily
consider their level of documented, internationally competitive research and their experience with higher-education development activities.
The ability to attract external funding will be considered together with outreach qualifications. Teaching qualifications are not mandatory,
but documented teaching qualifications and teaching experience will be considered.<br /><br />Further information about the Department can
be found at <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.ind.ku.dk/english/" target="_blank">https://www.ind.ku.dk/english/</a>. Inquiries about the
position and the department can be made to Head of Section Henriette Tolstrup Holmegaard, <a rel="noopener"

tenure-track programme</strong><br />An assigned mentor will provide the tenure-track assistant professors with guidance related to career
development, other academic topics and administrative procedures.<br /><br />Performance of the tenure-track assistant professor will be
